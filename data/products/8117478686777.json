Doctor Recommended Relief Anytime</h2>\n<p>Discover the gold standard in eye care with the Wizard Research Electric Dry Eye Mask. Trusted by over 2,600 eye doctors and clinics nationwide, this device provides consistent, soothing warmth to relieve dry eyes, reduce digital screen fatigue, ease sinus pressure, and calm headaches. Designed for daily comfort, it combines medical-grade performance with spa-like relaxation, making it the perfect at-home solution for lasting relief.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<h2>Why Choose an Electric Dry Eye Mask?</h2>\n<p>Millions of people suffer from dry eye syndrome, often caused by blocked meibomian glands that prevent natural oils from reaching the tear film. Without these oils, tears evaporate too quickly, leaving eyes dry, irritated, and uncomfortable. An <strong>electric dry eye mask</strong> targets this problem by gently warming the eyelids, melting trapped oils, and restoring natural moisture balance.</p>\n<p>Unlike microwave masks that cool too quickly, this electric mask maintains steady therapeutic heat for the entire session. With precise temperature control and a built-in timer, it provides safe, effective, and consistent relief every time.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of the Electric Dry Eye Mask</h2>\n<p>• Precise temperature control with 10 adjustable heat settings (99°F–117°F)<br><br>• Built-in timer with automatic shut-off for worry-free sessions<br><br>• Option for dry or moist heat therapy—add a dampened insert for deeper hydration<br><br>• Soft, washable cotton cover for hygiene and comfort<br><br>• Contoured, patented design for a secure fit around the eyes<br><br>• USB-powered for use at home, in the office, or while traveling<br><br>• Durable, premium materials built for long-term daily use</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<h2>Benefits of Daily Use</h2>\n<p>Regular use of an <strong>electric dry eye mask</strong> can make a noticeable difference in comfort and eye health.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>• Relieves dryness, itching, burning, and watery eyes<br><br>• Helps manage Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD)<br><br>• Reduces puffiness and morning swelling<br><br>• Eases sinus pressure and headaches<br><br>• Alleviates digital screen fatigue from computers and phones<br><br>• Improves tear film stability and hydration</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>With just 10–15 minutes a day, you’ll experience soothing relief and long-lasting improvement in eye comfort.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<h2>How to Use the Electric Dry Eye Mask</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Plug the mask into any USB power source.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Select your preferred heat setting from 10 available levels.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Set the built-in timer for your session length.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Place the mask comfortably over closed eyes and relax.<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For true moist heat therapy, lightly dampen the mask before use.</strong><br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The automatic shut-off ensures every treatment is safe and stress-free.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<h2>Designed for Comfort and Safety</h2>\n<p>Every detail of the Wizard Research <strong>electric dry eye mask</strong> is designed with your well-being in mind.
